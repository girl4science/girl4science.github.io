				<h1>Marie Curie</h1>
				<p>Marie Salomea Sklodowska-Curie was a polish physicist and chemist and the only person to win a Nobel Price in two scientific fields. Marie Curie remains a symbol of scientific achievement, resilience, and the breaking of barriers, as she worked in a male-dominated field and faced many personal and professional challenges.</p>

	  			<p>She coined the term "radioactivity" to describe the phenomenon of certain elements emitting radiation. In 1898, Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium and radium. Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes. She received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium and her pioneering work in isolating radium. Curie's research laid the foundation for cancer treatments that use radiation therapy. She also contributed significantly to the development of x-ray technology during World War I, helping to save countless lives.

	  			<p> On 4 July 1934, she died aged 66, in Passy of France, from aplastic anaemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, during her experiments and World War I, causing damage to her bone marrow. The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbooks are highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, which was published in 1935.</p>

		  		<p>1. The Marie Curie Award (from the American Association for Cancer Research): This award recognizes achievement in cancer research, particularly in areas related to the molecular basis of cancer. It is given annually to scientists who have made significant contributions to cancer research.</p>
		  		<p>2. The Marie Curie Fellowship: This fellowship, primarily offered by the European Commission, supports researchers in the early stages of their careers. It aims to promote international mobility and collaboration in scientific research across Europe.</p>
		  		<p>3. The Marie Curie Memorial Prize: Established by the Polish Academy of Sciences, this prize is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the field of science, particularly in the areas that Marie Curie pioneered.</p>
		  		<p>4. The Curie Award (from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, IUPAC): This award honors significant achievements in the field of chemistry, particularly in areas that align with Curie's contributions to nuclear chemistry and radioactivity.</p>
