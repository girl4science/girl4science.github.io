					<h1>Marie Curie</h1>
					<p>Marie Salomea Sklodowska-Curie was a polish physicist and chemist and the only person to win a Nobel Price in two scientific fields. Marie Curie remains a symbol of scientific achievement, resilience, and the breaking of barriers, as she worked in a male-dominated field and faced many personal and professional challenges.</p>

	  			<p>She coined the term "radioactivity" to describe the phenomenon of certain elements emitting radiation. In 1898, Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, discovered two new radioactive elements: polonium (named after her homeland, Poland) and radium. Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes. She received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. Then, in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium and her pioneering work in isolating radium. Curie's research laid the foundation for cancer treatments that use radiation therapy. She also contributed significantly to the development of x-ray technology during World War I, helping to save countless lives.
